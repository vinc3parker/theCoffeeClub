# The Coffee Club
A website that helps users find the right coffee shop for them near them

## Design
It will be made up of two pages:
- Maps Page
- Review and Create Page

## Idea
The website will be made so that it is easy for users to find cafes near them that have good coffee and the suitable space for their needs, be that a quiet stop to work, a busy place to meet friends or just some new place to try

## Cafe Review
Each cafe will be able to be reviewed with a simple review template which means data is easily collected and displayed to people searching for somewhere to go
